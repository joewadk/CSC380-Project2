# CSC380 Project

### In this project, we aim to create a fully functioning chatroom in C utilizing advanced cryptography skills. In particular we aim to establish:
* Write a handshake protocol to setup ephemeral keys (your protocol should have perfect forward secrecy!).
* Establish mutual authentication using public key cryptography.
* After authentication, each message should be encrypted and tagged with a message authentication code.
